# Unexpected Arguments Object Behavior in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `arguments` object in JavaScript functions.  The `arguments` object, while appearing array-like, is not a true array and has some quirks that can lead to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution for more predictable and consistent behavior.

## Problem

The `arguments` object is not a standard array. Using it directly in array methods can lead to issues.  Its properties, such as `.length`, can have unexpected interactions.

## Solution

Convert the `arguments` object to a proper array using methods like `Array.from()` or spread syntax (`...`). This ensures predictable and standard array behavior.
